# CCSF-Asset-Explorer
Asset Explorer focused on Narutimatte series CCSF files from Cyber Connect 2.

#About
 I started on RomHacking in 2018-2019 to translate the Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja 5 game to Portuguese Brazilian, on the time i dind't has this much knowledge i have now,
along the time i tried other games i loved such as Genji Dawn of the Samurai and it worked, i managed to modify a game for the first time, and to translate to my own
native language.
 Time passed again, and now i learned how to modify textures, texts, and program codes, with help of a bunch of people and WarrantyVoider's CCS File Explorer, HackStract,
 DataBinReader, StupidBlocks(He sure were angry about them kkkkk) amd NCDyson's StudioCCS, i must thank them for their job, i derived most of this code from StudioCCS
 master, but the knowledge from block structure came from the CCS File Explorer from WV.
 
#My Goals

 I want to open possibilities for people to modify Narutimate Series games and CC2 games such as naruto ones, i want everyone to be able to add more characters, more
 jutsu, specials, models, textures, songs, and so on...
